#OpenGL Game Engine

this is a project aiming to teach me the basics of OpenGL and the "behind-the-scenes" of game Engines.
This Project is by no means done, as only the core mechanics of it are implemented, features to be added include,
a UI implementation using IMGUI, the ability to save scenes, lighting etc.
